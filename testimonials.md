Gather was a wonderful replacement of our old online meal system - it's so clear and easy to use. And, it can do so much more than our old system could; its hard to remember how we managed without it.

I love, love, LOVE Gather! Gather has reduced meals accounting from 10+ hours per month to less than 2 hours per month. This has been a huge time saver for me (the accountant) and our community.

Gather has also completely removed meal questions altogether! Accounting and meal statements are so easy and understandable now, I’m no longer getting "which meals did I attend?" and other questions every month.

Our community has taken to Gather surprisingly quickly. We planned for a 2 month onboarding process, but after 2 weeks, all 34 households were fully using Gather for meals sign ups and accounting. It was very easy!

Overall I’ve been so happy and impressed with Gather!

I absolutely love Gather! Gather lives up to the promise of technology. It helps solve coordination problems that are difficult but annoying AND it doesn’t cause new problems or take up your time. It is an elegant technology that has helps a community to come together to collaborate on the shared joys (and drudgeries) of community life. Hooray for Gather!
