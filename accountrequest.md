# Request An Account

To get your community setup on Gather, please email [info@gather.coop](mailto:info@gather.coop) with the following information:

1. **Your Personal Google ID**<br/>This is usually a Gmail address. Your account will be given the Admin role and you will be able to add new users on your own.
2. **Community Name**<br/>We will use this to choose your sub-domain (e.g. `touchstone.gather.coop`). We will remove suffixes like 'Co-op', 'Cohousing', etc. to keep things concise.
3. **Sample Data?**<br/>Would you like sample data preloaded into your community so you can easily demo the system, or would you prefer to add your own (people, resources, meals, etc.)? We can easily remove the sample data later.
4. **How Did You Hear About Us**<br/>We'd love to know!

Gather is currently in beta and free to use. See the [pricing](/pricing) page for an idea of how we plan to keep Gather sustainable.
