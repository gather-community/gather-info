# Request An Account

To get your community setup on Gather, please email [info@gather.coop](mailto:info@gather.coop) with the following information:

1. **Your Preferred Email Address**<br/>Your account will be given the Admin role and you will be able to add new members on your own.
2. **Community Name**<br/>We will use this to choose your sub-domain (e.g. `touchstone.gather.coop`). We will remove suffixes like 'Co-op', 'Cohousing', etc. to keep things concise.
3. **Sample Data?**<br/>Would you like sample data preloaded into your community so you can easily demo the system, or would you prefer to add your own (people, resources, meals, etc.)? We can easily remove the sample data later.
4. **Timezone** What timezone are you located in? This will make sure that the calendar entries make more sense for your community.
5. **How Did You Hear About Us**<br/>We'd love to know!
