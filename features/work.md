# Work

Sharing in the work of running and maintaining the community is one of the most important and rewarding parts of
living together. It can also be one of the most tedious to keep track of.

Gather has a feature-rich and flexible system for work sharing. It is used with great success at Touchstone Cohousing,
where there is near-total participation in the work system and about 300 hours of shared work is performed each month.

* Jobs in the community are entered including the job description and the number of hours required.
* Members sign up for jobs of their choosing.
* Special jobs can be _pre-assigned_ to particular members before general job choosing begins.
* Multiple email reminders can be configured for each job.
* Jobs can be exported to your favorite calendar software.
* To promote equitable sharing, the system can automatically compute a quota for each worker based on the total amount of hours of work needed.
* Accommodations of reduced work hours (shares) can be granted to workers in need.
* Job choosing can optionally be conducted in rounds to reduce the number of people picking jobs at once.

Coming soon:

* Integration with the meals system for easier management of meals jobs
* Member-tailored job choosing announcements
