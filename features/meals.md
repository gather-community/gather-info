# Meals

Gather's initial purpose was as a meals administration system. Gather communities tend to have very healthy [meals programs](/assets/screenshots/meals-index.png). Meals features include:

* A full [billing system](/features/billing) for sharing meal costs
* Customizable [signup types](/assets/screenshots/meal-types.png) (adult, senior, teen, kid; meat/veg)
* [Customizable cost formulas](/assets/screenshots/meal-formula-form.png)
* [Beautiful, detailed reporting](/assets/screenshots/meals-report.png) so you can see how your meals program is working
* Exportable [meal calendar](/assets/screenshots/meal-calendar-entries.png)
* A pretty, printable [summary sheet](/assets/screenshots/meal-summary.png) for cooks
* Customizable meal roles (assistant cook, cleaner, etc.)
* Email reminders for workers, diners, and head cook menu entry
* Automatic integration with facility [reservations](/features/reservations)
* Ability to easily email meal attendees

Coming soon:

* Auto-signup (for communities with a full-participation/opt-out model)
* CSV import & export
