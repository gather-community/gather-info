* A full billing system for sharing meal costs (see below)
* Multiple [signup types](assets/screenshots/view-meal.png) (adult, senior, teen, kid; meat/veg)
* [Customizable cost formulas](assets/screenshots/meal-formula-form.png)
* [Beautiful, detailed reporting](assets/screenshots/meals-report.png) so you can see how your meals program is working
* Exportable [meal calendar](assets/screenshots/meal-calendar-entries.png)
* A pretty, printable [summary sheet](assets/screenshots/meal-summary.png) for cooks
