# Reservations

Community is all about sharing. Gather makes it easy to share common resources in a fair and organized way:

* [Book rooms](assets/screenshots/reservations-index.png), vehicles, or other resources
* Daily, [weekly](assets/screenshots/reservation-calendar.png), and monthly calendar views
* Customizable, rich-text resource [guidelines](assets/screenshots/create-reservation.png) so users are reminded of community policies at the time of reservation
* Fine-grained [reservation policies](assets/screenshots/create-reservation-with-error.png) including things like event type, max. days per year, max. length, max. days in advance, etc.
* Exportable [reservation calendars](assets/screenshots/calendar-export.png)
