# Billing

_Click the links below to see lots of screenshots from the system._

Tracking expenses and reimbursements allows a community to take meal sharing to the next level:

* Diners receive a regular [account statement](assets/screenshots/statement.png)
* They can view [current and past statements](assets/screenshots/accounts.png) and get payment instructions
* Automated [statement generation](assets/screenshots/accounts-index.png) and emailing
* Ability to [adjust meal signups](assets/screenshots/finalize-meal.png) at time of finalizing to accommodate late signups
* Cooks can receive a credit in lieu of reimbursement for grocery expenses
* Adjustable, per-user credit limits
