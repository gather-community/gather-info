# Wiki

Gather is the [hub for all your community information](/assets/screenshots/ts-wiki.png). Members never need ask "Where do I find that info?" ever again.

* Great for information that needs frequent and easy access
* Content can be authored in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for simplicity or HTML for greater control
* Page history is tracked and [previous versions can be compared](/assets/screenshots/wiki-compare.png) to see who changed what
* Key pages can be marked read-only for all except admins and those with the special 'Wikiist' role
* Data from external JSON APIs can be imported and displayed

Coming soon:

* Public wiki pages
* CSV export
