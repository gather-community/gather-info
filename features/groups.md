# Groups

Groups represent all the various collections of members in your community, including committees, teams, clubs, and so on.

Group membership can be open, closed, or a special 'everybody' setting which automatically includes all adult members of the community.

Users can join, leave, or opt out of groups themselves, and users can also be added or removed by group managers. The groups user interface is simple and approachable.

Gather offers two world class solutions for communication within your groups and community...

## Email Lists

Gather groups are integrated with Mailman, one of the most popular email list platforms.

Email lists can be attached to groups. A corresponding list will then be created
on the Gather Mailman server, and the members of the Gather group will be kept in sync with the Mailman list.

Use Gather instead of Google Groups or other similar solutions. The benefits are several:

* Information about individual members and about groups is housed in the same place: Gather.
* Group membership and email address changes are kept in sync with Mailman automatically.
* You can create 'Everybody'-type groups to include all adults in the community. New members are added automatically to the group, and deactivated members are removed automatically as well, for smoother onboarding and offboarding experiences.
* Group membership can be easily edited by group managers within Gather. This allows committee conveners to add their own members, for example.
* For moderators or list administrators who want to edit Mailman settings, accessing the Mailman UI is easy with single-sign on.
* Users also don't need to sign in to a separate system to see list archives.
* It's easy for community members to see who is in what group and on what list. Viewing a user's profile also shows what groups they are in.
* Your private message data is housed at Gather, which is fully accountable to you, unlike major ad-supported corporations like Google. Your data stays private and is not sold or analyzed.

## Discourse Forums

You can also use Discourse, the popular and fully featured forum platform, for communicating with your community.

Like Mailman, Gather hosts its own Discourse instance, so that all your data remains under one roof.

Signing in to Discourse is completely automatic if you are already signed in to Gather. No more passwords to remember. User accounts are synchronized transparently.

Gather Groups will also soon be synchronized with Discourse groups for deeper integration. That feature is under development.
