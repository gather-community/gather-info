# Planned Feature Roadmap

Gather does a lot but it could do so much more. We've got big plans.

### Top Priorities

(In rough order of priority)

* Full event calendaring system, tightly integrated with meals, reservations, meetings, birthdays, etc.
* Wiki attachments and Google Drive integration (see the [Google Drive FAQ](/google-drive-faq))
* Decision-making and task support including issue tracking, decision archiving, and meeting planning

### Other Major Goals

(In no particular order)

* Configurable permissions
* SMS support
* Member self-signup
* Group meal recipe sharing
* Wordpress integration for public pages
* QuickBooks integration
* HOA dues collection
* Private resource borrowing/lending
* Car sharing
* Maintenance access coordination

Also see our [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/gather-community/gather/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Aenhancement) for more things in the pipeline.
