Gather does a lot but it could do so much more. We've got big plans.

### Top Priorities

* Mailman integration for integrated email list support
* Wiki attachments and Google Drive integration
* Discourse integration for integrated discussion forum support
* Full event calendaring system, tightly integrated with meals, reservations, meetings, birthdays, etc.
* Decision-making support including issue tracking, decision archiving, and meeting planning

### Other Major Goals

(In no particular order)

* Configurable permissions
* SMS support
* Member self-signup
* Group meal recipe sharing
* Wordpress integration for public pages
* QuickBooks integration
* HOA dues collection
* Private resource borrowing/lending
* Car sharing
