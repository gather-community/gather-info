# Frequently Asked Questions

## Pricing/Sustainability

#### How much does Gather cost?

See the [pricing/sustainability](/pricing.html) page.

#### Why should we pay?

Communities deserve great software, and great software is expensive to build and maintain. See the [pricing/sustainability](/pricing.html) page for more detail.

#### Will Gather still be around in 5 years?

Almost certainly. Gather is already in heavy use in multiple communities which depend on it to run their meals programs, common spaces, member directory and more.

Building a bigger community of paying subscribers will only deepen the system's sustainability.

#### Can our community contribute labor in lieu of money?

Yes, as long as there is a firm and accountable hours commitment and those offering to contribute possess the necessary skills. [Contact us](/contact.html) and let's talk!

## Support

#### How do I get help with Gather?

It depends on the type of help you need!

* **Basic help** with using the system should be provided within the community wherever possible. This allows more time for Gather staff to work on making Gather better.
* **The broader community** is also available for help via the Gather discussion forum (coming soon).
* **Bugs** should be reported by [contacting Gather staff](/contact.html)

#### Is there a venue where we can discuss Gather with other users?

There will be very soon. We have plans to set up a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) forum for the community within the next few weeks.

#### Where do I report bugs or things that don't seem to be working right?

Please [contact us](/contact.html). We appreciate it!

## Users & Households

#### Do all community members need a user account?

Yes. This is a fundamental assumption of Gather's design.

#### What about children?

Children also have separate user accounts in Gather, but:

* Their user profiles are editable by their parents/guardians
* They can't sign in to the system directly and therefore can't sign their Households for meals, reserve resources, etc.
* They don't count in the calculation of the community's subscription cost.

Having children in Gather is useful for things listing them in the member directory, including them in the work-share program (coming soon), etc. But adding children is optional.

#### What are the different user roles and what can they do?

| Role | Abilities |
|---|---|
| Admin | All |
| Biller | View and update accounts, send statements, apply late fees, etc. |
| Meals Coordinator | Create and update meals and meals formulas, send meals messages |
| Photographer | Update user photos |
| Wikiist | Edit protected wiki pages, delete wiki pages |

#### What is the difference between Email and Google ID in a user profile?

Email is the address at which people want to be contacted.

Google ID is what people will use for sign in. If the person never needs to sign in, they don't need a Google ID.

#### How do households relate to units?

A unit represents a physical location like a house or apartment.

A household represents a group of users that share finances for the purposes of billing. Meal signups and billing statements are on a household basis for this reason. It wouldn't make sense to send separate statements to two members of the same household.

All users must belong to a household, but a household can have only one user.

#### Why do I have to sign in with Google?

We chose Google as the initial sign in method because it is easy and means one less password to remember.

Future integrations with Google products like Google Drive will also be made easier if all users have a linked Google account.

However, email/password sign in is a planned feature. If this is a deal breaker for your community, [let us know](/contact.html) and we can expedite it.
