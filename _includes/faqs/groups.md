#### How do I send an email out to the email list?

Simply send an email to the list address listed on the group page using your normal email provider.

#### When I reply to an email list message, who does it go to?

If you simply reply, it will go to the sender only. If you reply-all, it will go to the full list.

#### Why does an email I got say it's from "(Name of Sender) via (Name of Group)"?

Some email providers (notably Gmail) will do this if the sender is sending from Yahoo Mail or other providers. It has to do with anti-spam measures. You can safely ignore it.

#### Should I be getting a copy of an email I send to an email list that I'm on?

It depends on your email provider. Gmail notably does not show copies of messages that you send. Most other providers will show copies. You can always check the list archive to see if your message was distributed.

#### How do I create a new group with an associated email list for my book club, discussion group, project, or other purpose?

Please get in touch with your Gather Admin. They can create a group for you and make you manager of the group so you can then add other members to it.

#### Can external addresses be added to an email list for a group?

Yes, this is possible via the [Mailman admin panel](https://mailman.gather.coop) if you have administrator privileges on the list in question. If you can't make the change yourself, ask your Gather Admin.

#### How do I get into our Discourse Forum?

There should be a 'Forum' in your Gather main menu. If your community doesn't have a Discourse forum setup yet, please [contact us](/contact).
