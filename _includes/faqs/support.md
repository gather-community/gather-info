#### How do I get help with Gather?

It depends on the type of help you need!

* **Check this page** first to see if your question has already been answered.
* **Basic help** with using the system should be provided within the community wherever possible. This allows more time for Gather staff to work on making the system better.
* **The broader community** is also available for help via the Gather discussion forum (coming soon).
* **Bugs** should be reported by [contacting Gather staff](/contact)

#### Is there any documentation?

Not yet but there will be. We have been focusing our resources to date on building functionality, and relying on communities members to support each other in using Gather.

We recognize documentation is necessary, especially for some areas of the system. We will cover the most commonly asked questions in this document for now. When more substantial documentation is rolled out, we will move much of this content there.

#### Is there a venue where we can discuss Gather with other users?

There will be very soon. We have plans to set up a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) forum for the community within the next few weeks.

#### Where do I report bugs or things that don't seem to be working right?

Please [contact us](/contact). We appreciate it!
