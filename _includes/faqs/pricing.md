#### How much does Gather cost?

See the [pricing/sustainability](/pricing) page.

#### Why should we pay?

Communities deserve great tech, and great tech is expensive to build and maintain. See the [pricing/sustainability](/pricing) page for more detail.

#### Will Gather still be around in 5 years?

Almost certainly. Gather is already in heavy use in multiple communities which depend on it to run their meals programs, common spaces, member directory and more.

Building a bigger community of paying subscribers will only deepen the system's sustainability.

#### Can our community contribute labor in lieu of money?

Yes, as long as there is a firm and accountable hours commitment and those offering to contribute possess the necessary skills. [Contact us](/contact) and let's talk!
