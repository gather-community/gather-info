#### Why can't I delete a reservation after it has started?

Reservations can't be deleted after they have started because we feel this increases the incentive to only
reserve community resources when one is reasonably certain of needing them, rather than doing so speculatively
with the intention of possibly canceling later.

Reservations can still be _shortened_ after they have begun, and we recommend this as the proper course of action
for someone realizing they no longer need the resource. They can shorten the booking to end around the current time,
after which someone else is then free to reserve it.

If some communities disagree with the above then we can certainly make this an option in the system rather than a
hard and fast rule. Please let us know.

#### How do we set maximum booking amounts or maximum days in advance or ...?

Gather has a sophisticated set of protocols for governing reservations. They include:

* Fixed start and end times (great for guest rooms or other per-day resources)
* Customizable reservation types (e.g. personal vs. official) with the ability to set different protocols for different types
* Maximum days in advance
* Maximum reservation duration
* Household limits
    * Maximum days per year with a reservation
    * Maximum total hours per year
* Customizable notices that appear at the top of the reservation form
* Customizable resource policies that reservers must agree to when making a reservation
* For multi-community clusters, the ability to disable or require a sponsor for reservations from other communities

Each of the above is configurable for a single resource or group of resources.

#### How do I configure all the above settings?

Click 'Reservations' and then click the 'Protocols' tab. Create a new protocol or edit an existing one.
See the descriptions beneath each field in the protocol form for more information on what you can achieve with the protocol.
