#### How do we set maximum booking amounts or maximum days in advance or ...?

Gather has a sophisticated set of protocols for governing reservations. They include:

* Fixed start and end times (great for guest rooms or other per-day resources)
* Customizable reservation types (e.g. personal vs. official) with the ability to set different protocols for different types
* Maximum days in advance
* Maximum reservation duration
* Household limits
    * Maximum days per year with a reservation
    * Maximum total hours per year
* Customizable notices that appear at the top of the reservation form
* Customizable resource policies that reservers must agree to when making a reservation
* For multi-community clusters, the ability to disable or require a sponsor for reservations from other communities

Each of the above is configurable for a single resource or group of resources.

#### How do I configure all the above settings?

The user interface for editing these settings is still under construction. In the mean time, Gather staff can set things up for you upon request.
