#### Do all community members need a user account?

Yes. This is a fundamental assumption of Gather's design.

#### What about children?

Children also have separate user accounts in Gather, but:

* Their user profiles are editable by their parents/guardians
* They can't sign in to the system directly and therefore can't sign their Households for meals, reserve resources, etc.
* They don't count in the calculation of the community's subscription cost.

Having children in Gather is useful for things listing them in the member directory, including them in the work-share program (coming soon), etc. But adding children is optional.

#### What are the different user roles and what can they do?

| Role | Abilities |
|---|---|
| Admin | All |
| Biller | View and update accounts, send statements, apply late fees, etc. |
| Meals Coordinator | Create and update meals and meals formulas, send meals messages |
| Work Coordinator | Create and update jobs and periods, change shift assignments |
| Photographer | Update user photos |
| Wikiist | Edit protected wiki pages, delete wiki pages |

#### What is the difference between Email and Google ID in a user profile?

Email is the address at which people want to be contacted.

Google ID is what people will use for Google sign-in. If the person never needs to sign in or wishes to use password sign-in, they don't need a Google ID.

#### How do households relate to units?

A unit represents a physical location like a house or apartment.

A household represents a group of users that share finances for the purposes of billing. Several households may exist in a single unit. Meal signups and billing statements are on a household basis for this reason. It wouldn't make sense to send separate statements to two members of the same household.

All users must belong to a household, but a household can have only one user.
